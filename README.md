# Salesman-Problem
Self-Organizing Maps for solving the Traveller Salesman Problem 

This repository contains an implementation of a Self Organizing Map that can be
used to find sub-optimal solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

To run the code, only Python 3 and the dependencies (=matplotlib=, =numpy= and =pandas=,
which are included in the Anaconda distribution by default) are needed. 

This code is licensed under MIT License, so feel free to modify and/or use it
in your projects. If you have any doubts, feel free to contact me or contribute
to this repository by creating an issue.

This code was presented for the Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence course in
the Computer Science & Technology master's degree @ UC3M. A previous version of
this code can be found in [[https://github.com/DiegoVicen/ntnu-som][this repository]]. Special thanks to [[https://github.com/leo-labs][Leonard Kleinans]],
who worked with me in that previous version.
